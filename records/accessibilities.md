## Overview

We improved the accessibility of SMP to help vision impaired people using it with a screen reader. The main thing used is Accessible Rich Internet Applications (ARIA), which  is a set of roles and attributes that define ways to make web content and web applications (especially those developed with JavaScript) more accessible to people with disabilities. It supplements HTML so that interactions and widgets commonly used in applications can be passed to assistive technologies.

Below listed all the specified behaviours when using a screen reader.
